## Logic Overview

- Transactions are stored in localStorage for persistence.
- Each transaction has id, date, description, category, amount, and type.
- Summary is calculated by filtering and reducing the transaction list.
- Chart is updated dynamically based on expense categories.
- Voice input uses SpeechRecognition API to fill description.
- Export creates a downloadable JSON file.
- Import reads a JSON file and updates the transaction list.
- Theme toggle switches between light and dark modes.
